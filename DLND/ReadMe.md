## Five projects:

- Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
    
    Predict number of bikes required at a given point using a bike sharing data set
- Dog Breed Classifier
    
    Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds
- Generate TV Scripts
    
    Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts
- Generate Faces
    
    Learn to understand Generative Adversarial Networks and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN
- Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
    
    Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS
