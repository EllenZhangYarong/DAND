# PISA
## by Ellen Zhang


## Dataset

>PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

>Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy..

>In this investigate, i just focus on math-related data.


## Summary of Findings

>The math performance difference between the mean of the top 25% of students and the mean of the whole population in New Zealand is wider than in China. And New Zealand has a longer and wider spread than China. That means Chinese students are generally good, but there are not many especially excellent students among Chinese students. In New Zealand, there are more standout students among their peers. The competition between Chinese students is very stressful.

>In New Zealand, Math behaviours has a stronger effect on math performance than in China. As I know, there is very common for students to do a lot extra activities related to math. Their math grade won't improve much more even if attending more activities. But in New Zealand, as long as the students would love to do more about math, it would be improve their math performance.

>And we also see that math anxiety has a little negative relationship with math activity. That means the students work harder will decrease their anxiety. In China, this relationship(-0.379) is stronger than in New Zealand(-0.229). I guess that math studying in New Zealand is much happier than in China. The competition between Chinese students is too stressful.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> To top 25% student wherever they are in NZ or China, they still have a lot of anxiety and worries. But we can see from the violin plot we will see that the more they disagreed the anxiety, the better the academic performance they got. But doing more math activities cannot improve math grade more!

> Always to help friends study math and talk math with friends are two effective ways to improve their math performance. So the study buddy is a really good approach to help students with each other.
